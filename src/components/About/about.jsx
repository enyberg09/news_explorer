      <p className="about__text">
        Hi, I’m Elissa — a web developer passionate about building clean,
        responsive, and user-friendly applications. Through my training at
        TripleTen’s Software Engineering program, I’ve gained hands-on
        experience working with both frontend and backend technologies to bring
        real-world projects to life.
      </p>

      <p className="about__text">
        I specialize in frontend development, using HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid,
        responsive design), and JavaScript (ES6+) to create accessible,
        intuitive interfaces. I also work extensively with React, leveraging
        components, hooks, and state management to build dynamic, interactive
        experiences.
      </p>

      <p className="about__text">
        Beyond the frontend, I have experience with Node.js, working with APIs,
        and handling databases for data storage and retrieval. I’m comfortable
        with modern development workflows, including Git/GitHub for version
        control, Figma for design collaboration, Webpack for bundling, and BEM
        for maintainable CSS.
      </p>

      <p className="about__text">
        During my time at TripleTen, I learned how to approach problems like a
        software engineer: breaking projects into manageable steps, writing
        clean and reusable code, and testing to ensure reliability. I’ve built
        full-stack applications, deployed them to the web, and collaborated
        using real-world tools and practices.
      </p>

      <p className="about__text">
        My goal is to help clients and teams bring their ideas to life — whether
        that’s creating a polished web presence, improving user experience, or
        developing a scalable application from the ground up.
